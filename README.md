# Hi, I'm Francis! 👋

Hello, my name is Francis, and I’m a Software Developer and Technology Enthusiast.

In 2023, I started my career in the technology area. I entered a great college to improve my knowledge, and in the same year, I dedicated myself to finding my first jobs in the field. I'm currently a back-end developer!

I am always looking to improve, learn, and take advantage of innovative technologies. The future has arrived.
